**Side Effects:** Soreness at the injection site, mild rash.
**Additional Information:** Varicella vaccine is highly effective in preventing chickenpox and its complications, including severe skin infections.

### Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and acellular Pertussis)
**Composition:** Tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate.
**Schedule:** Administered at 11-12 years.
**Indication:** Booster for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis immunity.
**Side Effects:** Pain at the injection site, mild fever.
**Additional Information:** Tdap boosters are recommended every 10 years to maintain protection against these bacterial infections.

### HPV (Human Papillomavirus)
**Composition:** Virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of L1 capsid proteins from HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.
**Schedule:** Administered at 11-12 years, second dose 1-2 months later (if age 9-14 years), third dose 6 months after first dose (if age 9-14 years).
**Indication:** Prevents HPV infection (causes cervical cancer, genital warts).
**Side Effects:** Pain at the injection site, mild fever.
**Additional Information:** HPV vaccination is most effective when started before sexual activity begins, offering protection against HPV-related cancers and diseases.

### Meningococcal
**Composition:** Purified polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 conjugated to diphtheria toxoid or protein.
**Schedule:** Administered at 11-12 years (first dose) and 16 years (second dose).
**Indication:** Prevents meningococcal diseases (meningitis, septicemia).
**Side Effects:** Pain at the injection site, mild fever.
**Additional Information:** Meningococcal vaccination is recommended for adolescents to protect against these potentially deadly bacterial infections.
